# Hi, I'm Rohit 👋

I build interactive web experiences that feel alive — not just functional.

I’m interested in:
- Creative frontend engineering (React, Canvas, Motion, UI systems)
- Designing code that’s easy to understand, extend, and remix
- The open web and tools for creators

### What I’m working on
- Cursor-based masking and reveal systems
- Organic particle effects (dust, fire, motion trails)
- A modular creative-dev portfolio built with Vite + React

### How I think
I care about:
- Accessibility and performance as creative constraints
- Systems over demos
- Code that teaches, not just runs
