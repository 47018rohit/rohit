# Hi, I'm Rohit 👋

I like building things for the web that move, react, and sometimes misbehave — in a good way.

I’m interested in:
- Creative frontend engineering (React, Canvas, Motion, UI systems)
- Open, hackable tools for designers and developers
- Turning small ideas into systems people can remix

### Currently experimenting with
- Cursor-based masking & reveal effects
- Organic particles (dust, fire, motion trails)
- A modular creative-dev playground built with Vite + React

### How I build
- I treat performance and accessibility as creative constraints
- I design code to be explored, not just executed
- I prefer systems over demos
